Bioenergy and biofuel production and use are ones of the prerequisites for reducing greenhouse emissions and achieving sustainable development. On the basis of review and analysis of research achievements and elaborated ontologies in this field, an ontology covering sustainable bioenergy concepts, regulations, standards, criteria and referring indicators is proposed. A methodology for its development is presented, including goals and scope definition; composition of the text corpus and the extraction of the main concepts; controlled vocabulary and thesaurus building; ontology coding, reasoning, verification and querying. The established ontology is linked by the common concepts to the existing ontology for sustainable development as well as to other bioenergy, biofuel and biomass ontologies and is published in GitHub. The problem of the lack of an open ontological repository in the area of sustainable development and renewable energy is discussed together with the contribution of the current research for covering this gap.
